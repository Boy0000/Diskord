# Diskord
A mostly implemented Kotlin client for Discord

This project should still be considered as in-progress, as it likely still has bugs and the testing could be better.

Feel free to submit a PR or an Issue and I'll address the issue ASAP.

### Things to do
- Add testing
- Add OAuth2 client
- Rework clients to be async, probably using coroutines to stick to language convention
